#Web development practice
This folder contains my practice work used to learn the various web technologies.
Note that I use a file naming scheme as follows:
	-> The prefix in the name denotes the web technology to be practiced in that file.
	   However other technologies could help with that practice.
	-> The remainder of the name denotes a unique identifier for the file and gives an
	   idea of the content within the file.

An example could be:
	-> html_headings.html
